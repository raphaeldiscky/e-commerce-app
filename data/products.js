      'The G2A4 is a semi-automatic high damage battle rifle. It is an incredible consistent weapon. Fulfilling a specific niche between the assault rifles and sniper rifles, it has the ability to remain competitive at mid ranges againts assault rifles, while still being able to take on sniper rifles at range. Close range combat should be avoided due to the G2A4 slow rate of fire. Trigger discipline is needed with this weapon against distant and/or highly mobile targets, as it has enough recoil to slightly offset your aim.',

    description:
      'The Hemlok BF-R is a heavy burst-fire assault rifle employed by both IMC and Militia forces fighting on The Frontier. Although not as commonly seen as the more standard R-101C Carbine and R-201 Assault Rifle, the Hemlok is still a relatively common sight amongst the hands of Pilots, Grunts and Spectres alike. Its integrated CPU can fire controlled bursts from two, three, five or to a full magazine dump in one trigger pull. Its bulk has been weighted specifically for recoil compensation, as escaping gases port from the multiple vents located near the muzzle. With ideal stopping power and a high caliber round, the Hemlok is a worthy choice of elite Pilots of the Frontier.',

    description:
      'The R-97 is a compact submachine gun that excels in close-quarters combat due to its high fire rate and magazine size. It has the fastest fire rate out of all primary weapons; this, coupled with its large magazine size make it perfect for clearing entire squads in confined spaces. Despite this, it has very low damage output per shots, very short effective range and high weapon kick make it ill suited for combat beyond the shortest of ranges, although burst firing can improve accuracy, the low damage often makes this negligible.',

    description:
      'The Longbow-DMR, boasting high damage per shot consistent to all ranges, is an ideal long range marksman rifle. Presumably, this was to further separate its role from that of the G2A5 rifle, and prevent players from seeing it as a comparable battle rifle. The Longbow is a sniper rifle (which uses sniper ammo) that once again boasts long-range accuracy and single-shot stopping power in exchange for a small base magazine of 6 and once again can go up to 12, with limited close-range performance. It can be modified in the field with attachments for a sniper scope, an extended sniper mag, and a sniper stock for improved handling. ',
